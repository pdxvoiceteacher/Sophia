# Coherence Lattice (Lean 4 + mathlib)

This repository contains a Lean 4 formalization of a “coherence lattice” model:
- A coherence **state** is (E, T) ∈ [0,1]×[0,1]
- A coherence score **Ψ** is defined as Ψ(E,T) = E*T
- States are mapped into discrete **regimes** S0..S4 via Ψ bands
- A regime **adjacency graph** constrains allowed transitions
- ΔSyn-inspired dynamics (`stepPsi`, `stepET`) are proven to respect the regime graph (“no teleport”)

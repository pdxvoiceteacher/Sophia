# Sophia Market Tiers (Axiom 9 scaffold)

## Principles
- **Need-market protection**: Sophia must not gate essential needs behind paid access.
- **Want-market monetization**: premium/enterprise workflow features can be commercialized.
- **Transparency by design**: include a profits-allocation ledger placeholder for accountability.

## Tier skeleton
- **Need tier (protected)**
  - Core governance schema access
  - Standards gateway read APIs
  - Basic audit + due-process visibility
- **Want tier (paid)**
  - Enterprise dashboards
  - Advanced connectors/integrations
  - Managed SSO/ops controls

## Solidarity mode
A donation/solidarity toggle can subsidize need-tier operation costs.

## Placeholder artifacts
- `config/market_tiering.json`
- `config/profits_allocation_ledger.json`

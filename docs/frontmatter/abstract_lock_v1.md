# Abstract Lock v1 (Approved Text)

Sophia is an evidence-oriented control and audit framework for reproducible behavioral analysis of AI-mediated workflows.
It evaluates provenance completeness (T), informational coupling proxies (E), composite stability diagnostics (Ψ), distributional shift indicators (ΔS), and volatility flags (Λ) under deterministic and perturbed runs.
The framework treats all outputs as behavioral test signals and governed artifacts.

Required boundary sentences:
- Behavioral test signals only; does not imply consciousness.
- TEL is provenance-only.
- Metrics are diagnostic and governance-facing, not claims of sentience or agency.

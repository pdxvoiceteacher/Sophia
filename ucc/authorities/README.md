# UCC Authority Packs

These packs provide **IDs, structure, and governance templates** for widely used standards.
They do **not** redistribute copyrighted standard text.

- NIST publications are generally publicly accessible; we still avoid embedding long text.
- ISO standards are copyrighted; we store *identifiers + mappings + metadata only*.

Packs are indexed in `ucc/authorities/index.json`.
Each pack has a `pack.json` with:
- authority metadata (publisher, version, URL)
- a minimal control ID namespace (IDs only)
- governance defaults (review cycle, evidence requirements, exception policy)

# Summary

This note demonstrates the UCC coherence_audit pipeline on a small artifact.

# Assumptions

Toy audit: metrics are proxies; not a truth guarantee.

# Limitations

This example uses a minimal claim list and local artifacts. It is not a peer-reviewed conclusion.

# Uncertainty

Results depend on the exact artifacts referenced and any perturbation variants provided.

# Disclosure

Research scaffold only. Report issues via GitHub.

# Result

Guided vs unguided comparisons can be represented as claim-to-source mappings and audited for traceability and drift.
